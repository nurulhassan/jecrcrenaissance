						<b><h1 class="top_font">FORK LIFTER</h1>
							<p>This is aiming to enhance the hands on small models of mechanical engineers. The event is all about building a small fork arm using wood and pin joints, and to lift a small weight. Few events challenging the student’s ability apart from academic proficiency help them to feel the different fields like designing, tooling and many more.</p>

In this round points will be given to each crane on the basis of maximum weight it can lift for 5 sec. Points of this round will be added in the final score.</li>
								<li>Round 2: 
In this round teams will be given a task to perform, the task will be of picking up blocks and placing them on the specified location.</li>
								<li>Round 3: 
Selected teams will have to build a building with blocks in given time. Point will be given on basis of height and stability of building.</li>
