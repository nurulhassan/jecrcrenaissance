							<p>Renovators is a technical event that falls right in into the core of engineering. It emphasis on the basic circuits that are involve in the course of engineering. It also disperse light onto the innovation and creativity. </p>
							<p>There are 2 rounds, first about the identification of circuit elements and second about the design of already studied circuit</p>

								<li>Round 1(Objective)(1hr) identifying the missing circuit elements or output. </li><br>
								
								<li>The circuits are drawn onto the paper with some elements missing. The participant has to identify the missing elements, such that the output of the circuit remains same (or within a permissible range). </li>

								<li>The circuits are taken from the electronic, electrical , communication , and engineering physics and are the simple illusion of the basic circuitry.</li>
								<li>There will be a fixed time given to the participants for the identification of missing elements of circuits.</li><br>

								<li>Round 2 :(2 hr)</li><br>
								<li>Designing the circuits chosen from the vast set of circuit that are pre- decided.</li>
								<li>The participants have to choose the circuit that they can design It is Given By List of experiment list . Then they have to make as much circuits as they can in the limited amount of time.Tteams have to make the circuits in the hardware form(Sheet and Bread boad).</li>
								<li>Circuit may be judge by the respective teachers for the correctness and innovation.</li>
								<li>The participants that are short listed for this event have to make the circuit they have designed in the round 2 on practical hardware.</li>
								<li>This round may be time limitless.</li>
								<li>The circuits are then to be judged on the basis of the complexity of circuit and use of new and innovative thinking.</li>
