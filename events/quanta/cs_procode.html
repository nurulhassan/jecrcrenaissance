                          	 It Will be a 2 - 3hour Competitive programming contest hosted on Hackerrank. The Contest will consist of 5 - 6 problems based on Basic Implementation, Data structures and Algorithms, Mathematics and Logic. Students have to code the solution in any programming language of their choice. In this contest problems are designed in such a way along with the ability to test data structures and algorithms, the candidate is also checked with fundamentals of mathematics, logical aptitude, time and space complexities knowledge. If a candidate has command on any programming language he/she can do coding in that language with full access to the internet. 
                          </p>

							<b><p> It is an INDIVIDUAL contest (i.e. Team Size= 1 person/team). The individual will be ranked on the basis of the SCORE gained. Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time. Total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus some penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error, Compilation Error). There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved. </p>
								<p>ALL programming languages, which are supported on Online Platforms like CodeChef/Hackerrank/Hackerearth are allowed. Any discussion on strategy, suggestions or tips of the problem is NOT allowed during the contest. Any participant found to be indulging in any form of malpractice will be immediately disqualified. Any Electronic Gadget like Mobile Phones, Pendrive, CD is not allowed in the contest. Use of the Internet is ALLOWED. This competitive coding round has 5-6 programming questions. You are expected to solve them all in 2 hours. </p>
