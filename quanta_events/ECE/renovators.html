	           Renovators is a technical event that falls right in into the core of engineering. <br>
             It emphasis on the basic circuits that are involve in the course of engineering.<br>
              It also disperse light onto the innovation and creativity.

          Round 1(Objective)(1hr) :  Identifying the missing circuit elements or output.<br>
     		The circuits are drawn onto the paper with some elements missing. The participant has to identify the missing elements, such that the output of the circuit remains same (or within a permissible range).
     		<br>The circuits are taken from the electronic, electrical , communication , and engineering physics and are the simple illusion of the basic circuitry.
     <br>Round 2 :(2 hr)
     <br>Designing the circuits chosen from the vast set of circuit that are pre- decided.
    <br> The participants have to choose the circuit that they can design It is Given By List of experiment list . Then they have to make as much circuits as they can in the limited amount of time. Tteams have to make the circuits in the hardware form(Sheet and Bread boad).
    <br> Circuit may be judge by the respective teachers for the correctness and innovation.
    <br> The participants that are short listed for this event have to make the circuit they have designed in the round 2 on practical hardware.
  <br>   This round may be time limitless.
     <br>The circuits are then to be judged on the basis of the complexity of circuit and use of new and innovative thinking.
